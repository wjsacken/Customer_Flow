Python Files in the Customer_Flow Project
1. customers.py
Purpose:
The customers.py module is the backbone for handling customer-related operations. It provides tools to create, update, and delete customer records and is designed to maintain the integrity of customer data.

Key Features:

Customer Creation: Create new customer entries with unique IDs.
Customer Updates: Update existing customer data, such as contact details or other attributes.
Customer Deletion: Safely remove customer records without impacting other data systems.
Usage: This file likely defines a Customer class or utility functions, which could look something like:

python
Copy code
def add_customer(customer_data):
    # Logic to add a customer to id.csv
    pass

def update_customer(customer_id, new_data):
    # Logic to update customer details
    pass

def delete_customer(customer_id):
    # Logic to delete customer by ID
    pass
2. data.py
Purpose:
This module focuses on data manipulation and transformation. It is likely used to process the raw data imported from external sources and prepare it for use in the application.

Key Features:

Data Parsing: Read and parse data from files like id.csv.
Data Transformation: Clean and structure the data to make it suitable for further processing.
Validation: Ensure the data adheres to the required schema or format.
Potential Functions:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

def read_id_csv(filepath):
    return pd.read_csv(filepath)

def validate_data(data):
    # Validate and return cleaned data
    pass

def export_cleaned_data(data, output_path):
    # Save processed data back to a file
    pass
3. hub.py
Purpose:
The hub.py script serves as the central integration point, orchestrating interactions between customers.py, data.py, and the JSON and CSV files (ticket_types.json and id.csv).

Key Features:

Module Integration: Acts as the entry point for the application, invoking functions from customers.py and data.py.
User Interaction: If the project has a CLI or GUI, it likely resides here.
Control Logic: Manages the workflow for handling customer data and tickets.
Example Workflow:

python
Copy code
from customers import add_customer, update_customer
from data import read_id_csv

def main():
    # Load customer data
    customer_data = read_id_csv('id.csv')

    # Example operation
    add_customer({'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'johndoe@example.com'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
Data Files Supporting Python Scripts
id.csv
Role: Stores customer ID data and potentially other related information.
Format: CSV file with columns like ID, Name, Email, Phone, etc.
Example:
csv
Copy code
ID,Name,Email,Phone
1,John Doe,johndoe@example.com,555-1234
2,Jane Smith,janesmith@example.com,555-5678
ticket_types.json
Role: Defines ticket types available for customer service interactions.
Format: JSON file structured as key-value pairs, with keys representing ticket IDs or types.
Example:
json
Copy code
{
    "1": "Technical Issue",
    "2": "Billing Inquiry",
    "3": "General Question"
}
How They Work Together
Data Flow:

The hub.py file loads data from id.csv and ticket_types.json.
The data.py module processes the loaded data to validate and clean it.
The customers.py module handles CRUD operations on customer records.
Integration:

When a user needs to add a new customer, hub.py calls the appropriate function from customers.py.
If a data export or validation is required, hub.py leverages data.py.
Modularity:

Each Python file has a well-defined role, ensuring the application remains modular and easy to maintain.
